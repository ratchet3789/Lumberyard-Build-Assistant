# Lumberyard-Build-Assistant
A C# Windows Form based Lumberyard WAF build assist tool.

## What?
This is a small tool to automate the build process for Lumberyard's WAF tool. It came from the lack of a build tool in Lumberyard alongside the confusion of Lumberyard developers who had not used Lmbr War previously.

## How to Use
Place the latest release in your Dev folder in Lumberyard and run it. As you change settings it will generate a build command that will then launch Cmd.exe and automatically run the build you have chosen.
